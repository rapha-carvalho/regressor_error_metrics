# Handling regressor problems

## Project objective 

The main goal of this project is to store useful functions or classes to handle regression problems in python.

## Classes and functions

Filename | Content
----------------|--------------------
[comparisor.py](https://github.com/rapha-carvalho/regressor_utils_python/blob/master/comparisor.py) | This class receives a dataset as an input and evaluates it in a selection of regression models. It uses the functions contained on [metrics.py](https://github.com/rapha-carvalho/regressor_utils_python/blob/master/metrics.py) to evaluate each model's performance. 
[metrics.py](https://github.com/rapha-carvalho/regressor_utils_python/blob/master/metrics.py) | This class receives a fitted regression models and evaluates it on a vast amount of error evaluation metrics.
